Creating a more sophisticated shopping mall application with distinct interfaces for customers and mall owners (admins) involves several steps. This requires a clear design, a robust backend, and a user-friendly GUI. Here's a structured approach to achieve this:

Key Features
User Authentication

Separate login for customers and admins.
Session management.
Mall Selection

Display available malls to customers after login.
Allow customers to select a mall to view and purchase products.
Admin Interface

Allow admins to upload credentials for their malls.
Admins can manage products, view sales, and manage inventory.
Customer Interface

Display products available in the selected mall.
Allow customers to add products to the cart and proceed to checkout.
Implementation Plan
Define Core Logic

Implement classes for users, malls, products, inventory, customers, and shopping cart.
Design GUI with PyQt

Create separate interfaces for customer and admin.
Use Qt Designer to design the UI for different roles.
Integrate Core Logic with GUI

Connect GUI elements to the corresponding logic.
Handle user inputs and update the interface accordingly.
Database Integration

Use SQLite or another database to persist data.
Store user credentials, mall details, product information, and transactions.
